		<ul>
			<li>Female, mid-50's</li>
			<li>Patty is a rental property owner</li>
			<li>Patty has a very basic understanding of the internet:
				<ul>
					<li>Loosely knows how to upload pictures to websites</li>
					<li>Knows how to type up property ads</li>
					<li>Knows how to correspond via email</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Mostly accesses the website via desktop computer, though light mobile use as well.</li>
			<li>Skeptical of technology, but recognizes that she needs to use it to find tenants in the 21<sup>st</sup> century</li>
			<li>She uses the site solely to list properties for rent and to find potential tenants.  This is the need the application aims to fill: she needs tenants for her properties, Craigslist can put her in touch with potential tenants.</li>
			<li>She chooses to use Craigslist because of the wide user-base, because of it's visual simplicity, and because she can easily understand how to make listings.</li>
		</ul>
